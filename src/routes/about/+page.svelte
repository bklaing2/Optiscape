<h1>About Optiscape</h1>

<p class="mt-8">
	Optiscape brings every word to life with immersive audio that amplifies your imagination. It
	enhances the ebook experience by adding sound effects, ambience, and music. Music and ambience
	will automatically change depending on the setting of the book, and sound effects will play as you
	read.

<p class="mt-8">
	Anyone may contribute by <a href="/edit" class="underline inline">adding audio to a book</a>.
	Simply select the start of the section of text where you would like to add sound and an option
	will appear to choose SFX, ambience, or music. If you are adding ambience or music, you then
	select where the audio should stop. You may then search for and submit the sound.
	<br /><br />
	Please be mindful that sounds are added for everyone who visits the site, like a wiki. Similarly, if
	you delete an existing sound from the book it is deleted for everyone.
